The Gaming Room


Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is looking to expand their game Draw It or Lose It from just being able to be played on the Android. They are looking to make the game cross-platform, and are considering one of three Operating Systems (Linux, Windows, or MacOS) for their cross-platform game. The Gaming Room wanted ther to be only one instance of the game in the memory allowed, for the users to have unique ID's and team names to be unique as well, the game is to be held on a web based application so to reach a larger user base. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

Evaluation of the Server Side, Client Side, Developmental Tools. As well as come up with the design constraints.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The design Executive Summary helped the most when it came down to writing the code because it gave me an overview of what the client was looking for the code to be written like and how the users, team, and the number of games allowed would be.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The recommendations is the part I would revise. I feel that there were areas in it that I could have used more time in researching and finding possibly better solutions for the client to save or get a better system that would work with the Operating System chosen and the server they would use. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Yes I would implement the user's needs into the software design because it is their product. Ultimately when I am doing a job the clients ideas and needs will come first. However, if there is a way to explain to the client that there is a better and more cost effective way to handle things, I would inform them and see what decision they would make. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I started with the little knowledge that I had about Operating Systems and expanded through the resources given to me at first. Then I expand in the use of research that could be found by looking into major tech companies and their system specifications. For syimilar software applications, I would use the same methods I used on this project and expand them with further research into products that are better suited for the client.
